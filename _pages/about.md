I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **Department of Computer Science, University of Salerno**, where I work on advanced computational methods for **genomics, bioinformatics, and precision medicine**.

I received my **Ph.D. cum laude in Statistical Sciences** from *Sapienza University of Rome*, under the supervision of Prof. Umberto Ferraro Petrillo. My doctoral research focused on the development of **scalable and distributed computational frameworks** to tackle large-scale challenges in omics data analysis. This work culminated in my Ph.D. thesis, [Scalable solutions for large-scale bioinformatics analysis: a critical study of Apache Spark applications in high-performance computational genomics](https://iris.uniroma1.it/handle/11573/1745835), and resulted in several peer-reviewed publications (see the [Publications](/publications/) page).

My research activity began in 2020 within a project on **Big Data software services for decision support in Precision Medicine**, funded by the **European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT)**. During my Ph.D., I specialized in integrating **high-performance computing (HPC)** and **distributed computing paradigms** for complex bioinformatics pipelines.

I further strengthened my expertise in HPC by attending specialized training courses at **CINECA**, which led to the opportunity to serve as **Principal Investigator of a Class C ISCRA HPC project**, focused on efficient genome inference methods on large-scale **pangenome graphs**.

As a **research visitor** with the *Genome Data Science Group* at [Bielefeld University](https://gds.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/) headed by Prof. Dr. Alexander Schönhuth, I gained hands-on experience in applying **machine learning and deep learning techniques** to model and analyze DNA sequences.

My current research interests include:
- HPC for Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics  
- Machine learning and deep learning for Omics Data  
- Data-driven Methodologies for Health Informatics and Precision Medicine

An overview of my ongoing research activities is available on the dedicated [Projects](/projects/) page.
